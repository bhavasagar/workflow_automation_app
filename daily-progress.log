Started working on this project. 
Analyzing through all the frameworks required for this.
shadcn-ui is really good for the premium looking components.
aceternity-ui provides a lot of good styles/components.
nextjs will create routes for all the folders inside the app automatically 
if it is not required then we can create a route group by wrapping the folder name in (<floder name>)
